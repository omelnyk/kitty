=== 1. INSTALLATION ===

In order to install Kitty, you can use the traditional chain of commands on UNIX-like operating systems:

./configure
make
make install

=== 2. USAGE ===

Kitty package consists of two command-line utilities: kitty and meow. First one is a tool for solving sudoku puzzles and second one is a tool for verification that solution is correct.

Both kitty and meow use straight-forward puzzle format for input/output, where zeroes stand for empty cells (they can appear only in input, but not output) and numbers from 1 to 9 stand for themselves, eg.:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To solve a puzzle, you can save it in a file input.txt, and then call kitty as follows:

kitty < input.txt > output.txt

If puzzle has a solution, it will be stored in output.txt, else it output.txt will contain "No solution".

To verify that grid stored in file output.txt is a solution of puzzle stored in file input.txt, you can use meow as follows:

cat input.txt output.txt | meow
